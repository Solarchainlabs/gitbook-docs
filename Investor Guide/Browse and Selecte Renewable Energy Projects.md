After connecting to the PowerLayer platform, you can browse and select projects through the Projects channel. The platform categorizes projects into three types: ongoing projects for sale, upcoming projects, and active projects. You can participate in any ongoing project at any time, or subscribe to upcoming projects. We will notify you via email 24 hours before the project starts.
