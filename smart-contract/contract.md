# Contract

There are two contract code repositories: one is for implementing project management, Mint NFT, and NFT recycling functionality, and the other is for implementing an NFT trading marketplace.

Here is the Github link for the Contracts:  [solarchain-dapp-contracts](https://github.com/Solarchainlabs/solarchain-dapp-contracts)  and [solarchain-exchange](https://github.com/Solarchainlabs/solarchain-exchange) .

For Contract Addresses on various chains checkout the [Contract Addresses](addresses/) page.
