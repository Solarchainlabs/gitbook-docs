# Investor Guide

- **Browse and Selecte Renewable Energy Projects**  
     After connecting to the PowerLayer platform, you can browse and select projects through the Projects channel. The platform categorizes projects into three types: ongoing projects for sale, upcoming projects, and active projects. You can participate in any ongoing project at any time, or subscribe to upcoming projects. We will notify you via email 24 hours before the project starts.

- **Investment Process and Fund Management**  
     We will provide a step-by-step guide with screenshots to help you better understand the investment process on PowerLayer.
  
     **Selecte a Project**  
     You can find the case you want to invest in by browsing the ongoing projects. The solar power plant in Nonthaburi, Thailand, will be used as an example in this guide.
