# User Registration and Verification

* **How to Create an Account**\
  On PowerLayer, there's no need for users to register an account to participate in any renewable energy project sales. Simply connect your Web3 wallet would be enough. PowerLayer cannot access your assets, as you are not required to sign any transactions.
* **Identity Verification and Security Settings**\
  PowerLayer employs measures to protect users' identities and data security within its network environment. Unlike traditional Web 2.0 platforms, PowerLayer utilizes blockchain technology to implement decentralized identity verification. This means users can verify their identities through private keys and digital signatures, rather than relying on centralized authentication servers. This method greatly enhances the privacy and security of user data.\
  Additionally, the PowerLayer platform typically uses smart contracts to manage user permissions and transactions, ensuring transparency and immutability. To ensure security, users must safeguard their private keys and enable security measures such as multi-signature and multi-factor authentication to prevent identity theft or account breaches.\
  In summary, the core of PowerLayer's identity verification and security settings is leveraging decentralized technology to enhance user security while maintaining transparency and trust in operations1.
